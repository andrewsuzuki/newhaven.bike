          The Yale Loop one of two standard routes ridden on the Yale Saturday
          Ride (the two diverge around mile 19 at Time Out Tavern).
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is also a common route for ~50 mile solo rides, there are
          safer / more scenic choices. If you do decide to ride it alone, watch
          out for cars on the long stretch of Route 17 (Middletown Ave). Don't
          forget to stop for coffee at Cilantro on the Guilford Green!

          A classic! This route will take you up the "back way" and down the
          "front way" (counter-clockwise), but it's frequently ridden the other
          way too!
        </p>
        <p>
          The back way is closed to traffic year-round, but watch out for
          hikers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front way is closed to traffic during the winter only. If you're
          looking to train, it's common to do hill repeats on the front way
          (start at the parking lot gate, loop around the monument at the top,
          then descend back to the parking lot gate and repeat).

          Quick loop through Woodbridge/Bethany with a fast descent down Route

          This route goes down and up through not one, not two, but{" "}
          <em>three</em> river valleys. There's a fair bit of climbing, but it
          will pay off as you're guided through scenic farmland and some
          interesting microclimates.

        <p>
          There's a gas station around mile 22 if you need to fill your water
          bottles.
